## This scholarly article examines the transformative capabilities of blockchain technology in optimizing the Regional Transport Office (RTO) System Portal, thereby improving efficiency, security, and transparency in the delivery of public services. As governments globally adopt digital transformation strategies, blockchain emerges as a formidable solution to address challenges including data integrity, fraud prevention, and procedural inefficiencies. This investigation conducts a critical assessment of the current RTO system, pinpointing deficiencies in user experience, security, and operational processes. To mitigate these identified challenges, we propose a Blockchain-Enabled Framework that incorporates Smart Contracts for automated verification and employs the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) Consensus Algorithm to guarantee secure, decentralized, and immutable transactions. Through a comparative evaluation of various consensus mechanisms, this paper elucidates the appropriateness of PBFT for permissioned governmental networks that necessitate robust fault tolerance and deterministic finality. The proposed framework significantly enhances vehicle registration, licensing, and document authentication processes, thereby markedly diminishing fraud, bureaucratic delays, and operational inefficiencies, thus providing a scalable and future-oriented solution for public sector portals
